# The FIRST submission of a new add-on is always manual (listing details + review
# on the Developer Hub), so this builds the package, opens the Hub, and reveals the
# artifact to upload. For LATER version updates of an add-on already on AMO, push a
# semver tag: `npm version patch && git push --follow-tags` — CI signs and uploads
# the new version automatically via release.yml.
